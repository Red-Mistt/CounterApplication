# CounterApplication
Command line application interface to a simple tally counter class

This is a simple demonstration project.

Class Counter is an implementation of a tally counter like those used to count people
entering a concert. It stores a single integer value which is initially zero. Clicking
the increment button does the obvious thing. Clicking the reset button sets it back to
zero.

Class CounterApplication contains a basic command line interface for a single Counter
object.

Class FancyCounter demonstrates inheritance and adds some features.

We covered this in the lecture in Week 2.
